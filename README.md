# bash-processes-task

## Bash Project Idea: Process Monitor
### Project Overview
Create a Bash script that serves as a simple process monitor, allowing users to view, manage, and analyze running processes on a Unix-like system.

### Features
List Running Processes:

Implement functionality to list all running processes with essential information (PID, name, CPU/Memory usage).

#### 1. Process Information:

Provide detailed information about a specific process, including its PID, parent process ID, user, CPU and memory usage, etc.

#### 2. Kill a Process:

Allow users to terminate a specific process by entering its PID.


#### 3. Process Statistics:

Display overall system process statistics, such as the total number of processes, memory usage, and CPU load.

#### 4. Real-time Monitoring:

Implement real-time monitoring, updating the display at regular intervals to show the latest process information.

#### 5. Search and Filter:

Allow users to search for processes based on criteria such as name, user, or resource usage.


#### 6. Interactive Mode:

Implement an interactive mode where users can choose operations from a menu.


#### 7. Resource Usage Alerts:

Set up alerts for processes exceeding predefined resource usage thresholds.


#### 8. Logging:

Include logging features to record process-related activities, especially when a process is terminated.

#### 9. Configuration Options:

Allow users to configure the script through a configuration file. For example, users might specify the update interval, alert thresholds, etc.

## Configuration File
Users can create a configuration file (e.g., process_monitor.conf) with settings like:

```shell
# Sample configuration file for Process Monitor

# Update interval in seconds
UPDATE_INTERVAL=5

# CPU usage threshold for alerts (percentage)
CPU_ALERT_THRESHOLD=90

# Memory usage threshold for alerts (percentage)
MEMORY_ALERT_THRESHOLD=80
```

## üóíÔ∏è Please don't forget to source the configuration file & use bash in the interactive mode by writing this `#!/usr/bin/bash -i` in your script.
